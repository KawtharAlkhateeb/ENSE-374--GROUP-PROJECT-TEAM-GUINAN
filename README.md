## Project Idea
**The idea of team Guinan is to implement an Online voting system so that the voting process could be more streamlined and made hassle-free. The target is that university clubs and student union elections can be conducted online.**

## Project background/Business Opportunity
**There are multiple reasons behind team Guinan's motivation to implement an online voting system:**
- **Ease:** It is easier to organize or manage to vote online than offline because Guess What ?? Machine will do almost everything. Voters just need to cast the votes and counting will be done by the machine.
- **Environment-friendly:** I hope you guys love the earth as team Guinan does!! We hate the use of paper and other things that affect the environment. So go online and save mother earth !!!
- **Online is safer:** Many people chose to vote via email in the federal election as well due to covid. So why not build the system for elections within the university so that everyone stay's safe.
- **Monetary benefits:** Vote and save money !! No, you are not getting paid to vote. But no need to travel now as just sit at home log in with your ID, Password and cast your vote.
- **Better and engaging Experience:** No waiting in queues to vote now. Get a better experience sitting at home. Save your time and invest it somewhere else.


##### We saw the need for our project due to the present situation where people try their best to make the least contact with the people outside. If you can shop and eat online then why not vote ?? Initially we are planning to implement it in one sector of the university, like student club's or unions but later, as the requirement increases, so will the innovation!!!
